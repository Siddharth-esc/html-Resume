            <h2 align="center">Hello and Welcome!</h2>
            <!-- hello and welcome text --> I'm Siddharth Yadav, and I’m delighted to have you here! Ever since my school days at <a href="http://www.dpsraipur.in/">Delhi Public School Raipur</a>, I’ve had a passion for discovering new things. It was during this journey that I found my love for programming, which naturally evolved into my current pursuit of web development. Let me share a bit about myself and what you can expect from this corner of the internet.

            <h2 align="center">My Background</h2>
            <!-- My background text --> I completed my schooling at Delhi Public School Raipur, where beyond the traditional curriculum, I ventured into the world of programming. I gained knowledge from various sources such as YouTube, Udemy, and other geeky websites, which led me to the fascinating field of web development. This hands-on learning experience has equipped me with the skills to not only create websites but to do so with enthusiasm and love for what I do.

            <!--what sets me apart text--> What sets me apart from other developers is my belief in the distinction between those who work solely for money and those who are driven by passion and enthusiasm. I belong to the latter group, filled with utmost dedication to my craft. While I may not be one in a million, I am committed to healthy competition with passionate developers and meeting market demands with high-quality work.
